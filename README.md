# Fibonacci Generator Project

This Python project generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using a generator function.

## Project Description:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This project implements a **Fibonacci Generator** in Python that yields each Fibonacci number one by one up to a given number of terms.

## How the Code Works:
- The script defines a generator function `fibonacci_generator(n)` that produces the Fibonacci sequence.
- The `get_fibonacci_sequence()` function is responsible for handling user input, validating it, and printing the Fibonacci numbers generated by the generator.
- The program ensures input is a positive integer and provides informative error messages if invalid input is given.

## Instructions on How to Run the Project:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `fibonacci_generator.py` file is located.
4. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python fibonacci_generator.py
5. Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to generate when prompted
   ```bash
   Example Output:
   Enter the number of terms: 5
   The first 5 terms of the Fibonacci series are:
   0 1 1 2 3
## Error Handling:
If the user enters a non-integer or a number less than or equal to 0, the program will display an error message indicating that the input is invalid and prompt the user to try again.
